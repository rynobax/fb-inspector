- now -
keep url in sync
/project/project-name-or-id/path

provide project based on url
provide initial path based on url


- future -

show uids as time
search within view
preload if nothing else to do
save open state in projects
link to real firebase for editing

- maybe -
hyperlinks between uids and stuff
migrate serialized data
can use websockets to maybe get perf gains
can use firebase api to get projects
