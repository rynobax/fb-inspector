- now -
keep url in sync
/project/project-name-or-id/path
/help
/blah

- future -

show uids as time
search within view
preload if nothing else to do
save open state in projects

- maybe -
hyperlinks between uids and stuff
migrate serialized data
can use websockets to maybe get perf gains
can use firebase api to get projects
