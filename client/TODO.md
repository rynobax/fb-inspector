- now -


- future -
show tooltip with uid as time
link to real firebase
search box
export data at current path
search by key within view
-- release --
for projects, store added time for consistant sorting
delete users from server as well as client?

- maybe -
hyperlinks between uids and stuff
migrate serialized data
can use websockets to maybe get perf gains
preload if nothing else to do
save open state between projects

-- issues --
firebase keys are not sorted properly sometimes:
