- now -
allow show/hide projects
does refreshing token work?  It wasn't working immediately

- future -
visually seperate projects with different accounts
search within view
better ui for path editing not in url
show tooltip with uid as time
link to real firebase for editing
-- release --
for projects, store added time for consistant sorting
Warning: The following components suspended during a user-blocking update: SuspendedExpand, SuspendedValue
remove accounts
account avatars
delete users from server as well as client?

- maybe -
hyperlinks between uids and stuff
migrate serialized data
can use websockets to maybe get perf gains
preload if nothing else to do
save open state between projects

-- issues --
slow on dotaranktracker
