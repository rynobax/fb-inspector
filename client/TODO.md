- now -

- future -
export data at current path
disable network requests while scrolling
-- release --
for projects, store added time for consistant sorting
delete users from server as well as client?

- maybe -
hyperlinks between uids and stuff
migrate serialized data
can use websockets to maybe get perf gains
preload if nothing else to do
save open state between projects
show timestamp as time

-- issues --
firebase keys are not sorted properly sometimes:

switching projects doesnt load data

make sure that you cant delete data with oath token
